# Horizon-Simulation-Framework

The Horizon Simulation Framework (HSF) is a modeling and simulation framework developed by Eric Mehiel and his merry band of 
students at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.  The HSF was originally developed to model and simulate the operation of complex space-based
systems for the Aerospace Industry.  The HSF takes a model of the system, constraints and dependencies, and a set of tasks as
inputs and generates the state data of the system over a given time period.  The data generated can be used to analyze the
"Day In The Life" (DITL) of the system for system-level requierments verification.
