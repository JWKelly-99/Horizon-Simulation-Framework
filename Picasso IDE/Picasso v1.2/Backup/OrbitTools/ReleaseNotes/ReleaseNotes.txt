Revision History for OrbitTools assembly - Public (unlicensed) version.

Version 1.9.0.0 01/25/2009

   Corrected argument range checking in Julian.Initialize(). Also, the
   type of exception thrown if an argument is invalid has changed from 
   "Exception" to "ArgumentOutOfRangeException".

Version 1.8.0.0 01/02/2009

   The orbit axis recovered from orbital elements is now correctly
   associated with the semimajor axis (and not the semiminor axis).
   This change does not effect SGP4/SDP4 output calculations, but
   does correct class Orbit's convenience properties SemiMajor, SemiMinor,
   Major, Minor, etc. Thanks to C. Wee for discovering this issue.

   Renamed class Orbit's public property "mnMotionRec" to "MeanMotion".

Version 1.7.0.0 01/02/2009
   
   Added overrides of several functions to accept System.DateTime arguments.
   Converted Orbit.Period() to a property and changed return type to TimeSpan.

Version 1.6.0.0 08/08/2007

   Use invariant culture when parsing strings. 

Version 1.5.0.0 01/28/2006

   Namespace is now "Zeptomoby.OrbitTools".

Version 1.4.0.0 11/05/2005

   More interface rework; many methods are now properties.

Version 1.3.0.0 07/19/2005

   Fixed error in calculating Orbit.m_kmPerigeeRec (which is not used by
   the SDP4 or SGP4 algorithms). Accessor is now a property. Added Orbit.Apogee
   counterpart property.
   
   Added EpochJulian property to Tle class. Logic was previously located in
   class Orbit's constructor.  The Tle class has been updated to better work
   with the .NET property grid control.

Version 1.2.0.0 06/01/2005

   Rework interfaces using C# accessors. Minor code updates.

   Confusion in the Julian day constant values introduced a bug SDP4; the 
   constants were repaired.  Specifically, 2415020.0 is 12:00, on Dec 31, 1899,
   or the beginning of Julian "Jan Zero" in the year 1900.

   Simplify Tle.ExpToDecimal() by converting input string into Double-Parsable
   form, i.e., " 12345-3" => " 12345e-3", and then simply call Double.Parse().

Version 1.1.0.0 12/01/2004

   Baseline release.
